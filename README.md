# Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation in Julia

## Overview

A learning project implementing **forward mode automatic differentiation** for single-variable real-valued functions in Julia. Using dual and hyper-dual numbers, the program computes first and second derivatives through arithmetic operations and elementary functions.

The project also includes a basic Newton's method optimization algorithm as a proof of concept, applying automatic differentiation to locate function extrema.

## How It Works

1. **Define dual numbers:** Implement `HDual`, a hyper-dual number type storing a real value, two first-order derivative components, and a mixed second-order component.
2. **Overload operations:** Use Julia's multiple dispatch to define arithmetic and elementary functions for hyper-dual numbers.
3. **Calculate derivatives:** Evaluate functions using specially initialized hyper-dual numbers to extract first and second derivatives.
4. **Find extrema:** Apply Newton's method to derivative information obtained through automatic differentiation.
5. **Visualize results:** Generate random polynomials and plot the function, its derivatives, and estimated extrema.

## Main Functions

- `HDual` — Represents hyper-dual numbers and their derivative components.
- Arithmetic and elementary function overloads — Implement operations such as addition, multiplication, exponentiation, `exp`, `sin`, and `cos` for automatic differentiation.
- `d1(f, x)` — Computes the first derivative of \(f\) at \(x\).
- `d2(f, x)` — Computes the second derivative of \(f\) at \(x\).
- `newton_step(f, x)` — Performs one Newton optimization step using the first and second derivatives.
- `extremize_interval(...)` — Tries multiple initial guesses to locate minimum and maximum values over an interval.
- `rand_poly_coeffs(...)` and `polynomial(...)` — Generate random polynomial coefficients and evaluate the resulting polynomial.

## Running the Script

**Requirements:** Julia, `BenchmarkTools`, and `PyPlot`.

Install the required packages in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["BenchmarkTools", "PyPlot"])
```

Run the script with:

```bash
julia main.jl
```

The script generates a random polynomial, estimates its extrema over a specified interval, and plots the function alongside its first and second derivatives.

## Future Improvements

- Extend support to multivariable functions and higher-order derivatives.
- Improve numerical stability and handle zero-curvature regions and divergent Newton steps.
- Implement more robust convergence criteria and boundary handling.
- Compare performance against finite differences and existing automatic differentiation packages.
- Expand testing across different functions and verify derivative accuracy against analytical results.
